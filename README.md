## Development Timeline

Day1: Basic boiler plate code. An HTML and webpack configs. Do research on how to work with canvas to display what would probably be a grid/tiled display.
* Can move and jump around now.
* Only show a single pixel dot for the character.

Day2: Learn how to texture/animate with canvas.
* Changed the map size.
* Added basic textures for the platforms using a spritesheet.
* Added the twin cahracter that shares the same input.
